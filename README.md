# 🚀 Scala at Light Speed — Crash Course Journey

Welcome to my complete and quirky Scala journey! This project documents my hands-on completion of the legendary **"Scala at Light Speed"** course by [Daniel Ciocarlan](https://rockthejvm.com/) at **Rock the JVM**.

As a Python-native Data Scientist, I stepped into the world of Scala to explore its power in functional programming, type safety, and expressive abstractions — and this repo is my **evidence, journal, and playground** 🛠️

## 🌍 GSoC 2025 Contribution

This project directly supports my work as a **Google Summer of Code 2025 contributor** with the **Scala Center**. My assigned project:

🧩 **Project Title:** Add embedding support to LLMClient  
🔗 [Main Repository: llm4s/llm4s](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s)  
🧠 Focus Areas:  
- Type-safe embeddings integration  
- Functional design patterns  
- Extension of Scala-based LLM infrastructure

This crash course acted as the **foundation and fast-track** to mastering the Scala ecosystem for my GSoC journey.

---

## 💡 Highlights

- ✅ Clear, meaningful comments for each concept
- 🤓 Fun examples (like emoji printing & croc philosophers 🐊)
- ⚙️ Best practices using both **Scala 2** and **Scala 3**
- 🧪 Explorations into `Option`, `Try`, `Future`, `map`, `flatMap`, and type classes
- 🔁 Pure functional patterns replacing classic loops

## 🧠 Why I Did This

Scala is gaining traction in backend systems, data pipelines, and high-performance applications. I took this course to:

- Build fluency with the JVM
- Learn **functional programming** the right way
- Prepare for deeper Scala-based frameworks like **Akka**, **Spark**, and **ZIO**
- Contribute more effectively to my **GSoC project at the Scala Center**

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open it in **IntelliJ IDEA**  
3. Ensure the **Scala plugin** is installed  
4. Each file is self-contained and can be run individually  
5. Enjoy the magic ✨
